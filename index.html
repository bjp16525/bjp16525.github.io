	<P>The University of Georgia has always had a respectable and competitive football program since it first joined the NCAA, but this year the Bulldogs are on pace to complete the season with a better record than ever. UGA is nearing the end of their season and are still boasting an impressive record. Their results against other in conference SEC teams are shown in the table below.</P>

<h4>UGA's Run Game</h4>
	<p>One of the things that makes UGA's football team so productive this year is their collection of All-American runningbacks. Nowhere else in the country will you find a group of players that play the same position and are all capable of dominating the game whenever they are called onto the field. Their depth chart at the running back position is listed below. See each runningback's season long stats <A href = "http://www.georgiadogs.com/cumestats.aspx?path=football">here.</A></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Nick Chubb</li>
				<li>Sony Michel</li>
				<li>D'Andre Swift</li>
				<li>Elijah Holyfield</li>
				<li>Brian Herrien</li>
			</ul>
<h4>The College Football Playoff</h4>
	<p>Having lost our most recent in conference game to Auburn, UGA has been set back a little from their goal of reaching the College Football Playoff. However, given that we have already qualified for the SEC Championship, if we are able to defeat Kentucky and Georgia Tech in our final two regular season games, we will enter the SEC championship with only one loss. This means that if we are able to beat the SEC West's best team and become conference champions, we can fully expect to make the playoff. This would be UGA's first appearance in the playoff since the NCAA first introduced it in 2014.
